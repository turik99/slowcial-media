# Slowcial-Media

This is a social media website with a simple chronological image feed. Users can sign up with their phone number, add friends and make 1 daily post about whatever they like. The project remains unhosted while I clean it up and improve the UX.

The project is written with React.js and Node.js in TypeScript. The code interacts with a MongoDB server for user accounts and uses Amazon S3 and Amazon's CDN solution for user images. It is written to be as composable and readable as possible. Special attention was paid to handling complex database interactions well, as well as handling errors neatly.

Below are a couple screenshots of the product, which I also used as a design excercise.
