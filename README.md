# Slowcial-Media

Slowcial is a social media website with a simple chronological image feed.

Users can sign up with their phone number, add friends and make 1 daily post about whatever they like. The project remains unhosted while I clean it up and improve the UX.

The project is written with React.js and Node.js in TypeScript.

The front end and server interacts with a MongoDB server for user accounts and uses Amazon S3 and Cloudfront for user images. The code is written to be as composable and readable as possible.

Below are a couple screenshots of the product, which I also used as a design excercise.
